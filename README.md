# SamFetch

A simple Web API to download Samsung Stock ROMs from Samsung's own Kies servers, without any restriction, rate-limit, authorization or passwords. Made in Python, built with FastAPI, and ready to deploy to Heroku with one-click.

If you have a Heroku account already, you can click the "Deploy" button below and host your own instance without any setup. 

> **Why you wanting us to host it ourselves instead of publishing a public URL?**<br>
> SamFetch doesn't have any restriction itself, and I don't want to set up any restrictions such as rate-limit etc to keep it free (freedom) as much as I can. However, since this will allow spammers I recommend hosting your own instance, as you will have more control over it and you will have own private instance.

After typing your app name, deploy the app and your instance will be ready! Head over to `https://<app_name>.herokuapp.com/` and you will redirected to the OpenAPI docs, and it will show how to use the SamFetch.

| âš  **WARNING** |
|:--------------|
| Due to a change in Samsung Kies servers, you can only download the latest firmware even if you asked for a older firmware. This is not related to SamFetch.<br>[Issue Link](https://github.com/ysfchn/SamFetch/issues/6) |

## Features

* It doesn't collect any analytics, store cookies or have any rate-limits as it directly calls the Kies servers.

* As Kies requests authorization, it is managed automatically by SamFetch itself, so you don't need any authorization or add any headers on your end.

* It doesn't have any background jobs/queue for downloading and decrypting the firmware, so this means the firmware file will directly stream to your browser / your download client, while decrypting the chunks. 

* SamFetch supports partial downloads which means it supports pausing and resuming the download in your download client / browser's own downloader.

## Credits

This is a Web API variant of [Samloader](https://github.com/nlscc/samloader) project. I reimplemented the Samloader's functions as Web API routes and simplified the code for end-user to eliminate the authorization request, so SamFetch wouldn't be possible without Samloader.
